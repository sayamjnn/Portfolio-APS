            <li><p>Design approach for efficient and responsive search functionality:
                <br><span>To design an efficient and responsive search functionality within food-delivery apps, a well-structured approach involves constructing a data structure
                     that supports fast and accurate searches. A trie data structure can be an effective approach for this purpose. By implementing a trie, the system can store restaurant and
                      dish names.This allows for efficient prefix matching and real-time autocomplete suggestions.
                      The trie also supports exact match searches and can be extended for fuzzy search capabilities.

They can consume a lot of memory, especially with a large dataset, due to storing many nodes with null pointers. Additionally, tries can be less efficient in terms of space when the stored keys have common prefixes. This optimization makes radix trees more space-efficient while still providing fast lookup times. By using a radix tree, the search functionality can be optimized further, maintaining the benefits of fast prefix matching and autocomplete suggestions while using less memory compared to a traditional trie.

            <li><p>Design approach for efficient and accurate real-time order tracking system:<br><span>To design an efficient and accurate real-time order tracking system, we need to ensure that the system can dynamically calculate the optimal route for order delivery, adapt to real-time changes, and provide accurate ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival). 
                One effective approach to achieving this is by employing the A* search algorithm, a pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy in finding the shortest path.
